  "description": "**title:** *\"co-co-a-go-go\"*\r **Author** *Austin Cummings*\r **Description**\r     *This is a Mock proposal for a \"co-working\" client. This project should include a landing, contact, amenities and subscription pages. Ideally this project will represent the client as a a luxurious , cool high-end co-working space but still be 100% inviting and comfortable. It should Avoid the cliches of the 'big-guy' competitors. This means it should feel more natural and holistic and not so 'corporate' and stuffy as the 'big-guys'. It should appeal to not only the 'tech' crowd but also to \"artists, day-traders, Craftspeople, writers, counselors and traditional business people, anyone and everyone.''*"
