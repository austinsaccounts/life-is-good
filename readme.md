**title:** *"co-co-a-go-go"*
**Author** *Austin Cummings*
**Description**
    *This is a Mock proposal for a "co-working" client. This project should include a landing, contact, amenities and subscription pages. Ideally this project will represent the client as a a luxurious , cool high-end co-working space but still be 100% inviting and comfortable. It should Avoid the cliches of the 'big-guy' competitors. This means it should feel more natural and holistic and not so 'corporate' and stuffy as the 'big-guys'. It should appeal to not only the 'tech' crowd but also to "artists, day-traders, Craftspeople, writers, counselors and traditional business people, anyone and everyone.''*

  something like a coffee shop thats always open, with good people watching.

  comfortable relaxed workplace where we can have team meetings when we them with internet wifi and all the requirements a software company needs without the structured hierarchy of a corporate workspace reasons I need to speak with my co-workers about projects and ideas, but none of us need to be on call 24-7 or tied to an office or desk

  A place that affords the inimacy of a closed door for patients but entertainment , comfort and distractions for children/parents while they wait in the commons area. [privacy of an office, with distractions and ammenities for those who are waiting] reasons many of my clients have kids and tight schedules. I offer 45 minute seesions which is long enough to get bored waiting, but not long enough to arrange alternatives such as babysitters or pickup/drop-off.

  Ideally they want their own store, but as 2 young people with limited funds they're looking for a stepping stone that provides the space they need to create their products and occasionally have customers [all the resources and amenities they can have for the smallest upfront investment] reasons we put all of our savings into our company and we can barely afford Ramen so the idea of furniture, tables, internet, cable, telephone, occasional daycare and a lease is just too much.
